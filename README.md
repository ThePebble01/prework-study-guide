# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project serves as practice for building a "raw" webpage.  The specific goals and learnings are as follows:

- This will act as a foundational resource for me to experiment with webpages.
- It tracks notes and hopefully lets me continue with the course.  I plan on "fragmenting" this one webpage into multiple based on the topics covered.
- This has taught me:
    - The basic structure of files for a webpage.  I think more complex pages will organize their css, js into subfolders but we will see.
    - The basics of html, javascript, and css.
    - I don't want to do frontend coding, but I am excited to understand how it works.
    - Experimentation is key to learning.

A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
