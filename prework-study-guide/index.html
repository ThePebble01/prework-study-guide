        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The head and meta tags describe the page.  These are not visible to users.
          </li>
          <li>
            For some reason, the nerds that invented HTML called <'!DOCTYPE html> a declaration, but it seems to be the only HTML tag according to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp">W3 Schools</a>.  One-off things don't deserve a general name!
          </li>
          <li>
            Tags are hierarchically ordered.  There are parent tags that 'contain' child tags.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each tag has attributes that inform how browsers should 'handle' the content.
          </li>

          <li>
            Gonna have to bookmark a resource for this at future companies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Margin = space outside of the element; Padding = space within the element.  Using these proprties with unordered lists and the list elements is a great example.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within the blocks of the CSS file, a period designates a class selector.  The exact name of the class must follow the period.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a period is not applied, the styling is applied to any html tags that match the name of the CSS 'block'.
          </li>
          <li>
            Order of CSS parameters doesn't seem to matter.  "#3A864D 5px solid;" is equivalent to "5px solid #3A864D;""
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Open Questions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            How are styles applied to specific child tags?  For example, applying special formatting to the list items of this ordered list, but no other on the page.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review dynamically sizing elements...

        <h1>Git</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>
            I'm seriously going to have to bookmark the documentation for GIT wherever I work...
          </li>
          <li>
            git add -A is equivalent to git add * on windows (rsc to confirm).  I can save time by not having to type an extra character.
          </li>

            Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.  Asynchonous code is going to be fun to learn.

          <li>
            "falsy" = 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or false (bools)
